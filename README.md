# LSTM GNN Model Integrated with Clinical Code Node Encoding

BERT_model_preparation and Doc2Vec_embedding_preparation are the notebook to create clincial code embedding.

LSTM_GCN are the main file to run the model. 

You can download the description slides to read about the detailed introduction.
